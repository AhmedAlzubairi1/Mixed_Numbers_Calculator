# Mixed_Numbers_Calculator
This program is a calculator I created. The inputs can be any string values, including string numbers. Read readme for more info.

In this program a string is inputted. This string is a simple expression like 5 + 5. The program would read the input and output the value. 
THe use of this calculator is that it can take in mixed numbers in this syntax example 3_2/4. An example of an expression using the required
conditions is inputting -5_1/2 + 2_3/5  . This would output the value -2_9/10. This project was built for one of the main 3 projects for my AP Computer 
Science A class in high school (2016).
